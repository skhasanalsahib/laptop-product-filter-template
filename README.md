## Your Task

Your task is to add JavaScript functionality to this product filtering template by implementing:

- Brand filter - Filter laptops when user selects a brand
- Price range filter - Show products within selected price range
- Load and display products from the provided JSON API
- Update product display when filters change

Note: The UI components are already implemented. You only need to add the JavaScript functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. The input.css is only for future tailwindCSS implementation
4. The JSON dataset is available at [JSON Data](https://sujon3537.github.io/product-json/db.json)

## Implementation Details

- Created a sliding sidebar menu using pure CSS and radio inputs
- Radio inputs control the sidebar's visibility through `:checked` state
- Smooth left-to-right transition animation
- No JavaScript required for the toggle functionality
